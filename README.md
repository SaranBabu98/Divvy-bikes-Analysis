# Divvy-bikes-Analysis
To conduct simple analysis on members and casual riders who use Divvy bikes.

Divvy, a Chicago Department of Transportation program, is a bike-share system in Chicago and Evanston.The
company wants to convert casual riders into annual riders to increase the company's profit. As a data analyst my goal is
to find the answer to the question how casual riders are different from annual riders.
I follow six steps of analysis that is: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act. 


I have downloaded the csv documents and further made analysis on them
